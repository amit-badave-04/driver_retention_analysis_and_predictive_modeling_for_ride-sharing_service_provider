# Driver Retention Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Ride-Sharing Service Provider

## Project Overview

In this project, we addressed a critical business challenge faced by a leading ride-sharing service provider: the high churn rate among drivers. The company, a key player in the urban mobility ecosystem, was experiencing substantial costs due to driver attrition. The objective was to develop a predictive model that identifies drivers at risk of leaving the platform and implement proactive retention strategies to mitigate this issue.

## Problem Statement

The core problem revolved around the frequent turnover of drivers, which not only affected service consistency but also increased operational costs. The challenge was to understand the factors contributing to driver churn and develop actionable insights to retain drivers. Our analysis encompassed various driver attributes, including demographics, tenure, and performance metrics, to predict the likelihood of attrition and provide targeted recommendations.

## Skills Utilized

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM
- **Algorithms**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
- **ML Techniques**: Feature Engineering, Ensemble Learning, Model Evaluation (F1 Score, ROC-AUC)

## Analytical Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Managed missing data and transformed date fields.
  - Derived features such as driver tenure and performance trends.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Conducted a thorough examination of feature distributions and their relationships with driver churn.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Generated new variables, including tenure, joining year/month, and trend indicators for income and performance.

- **Model Development**:
  - Implemented and evaluated various ensemble learning models, achieving an F1 Score of 92.8% using the Random Forest model.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assessed model performance through key metrics, including F1 Score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

## Impact

Based on the comprehensive analysis, several key insights were uncovered, leading to actionable recommendations with the potential to positively impact the organization:

- **Reduction in Driver Churn**: The predictive model's accurate identification of at-risk drivers could reduce the churn rate by approximately 15%. This decrease in turnover would save the company substantial costs associated with recruiting and training new drivers.
- **Enhanced Driver Satisfaction**: By implementing structured income growth programs and financial incentives, driver satisfaction and retention rates could increase by up to 20%. This improvement would foster a more stable and experienced driver workforce, enhancing service quality.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Early retention programs, particularly targeting drivers within their first eight months, could prevent up to 35% of potential churn. This proactive approach would reduce the need for constant recruitment efforts, allowing for better allocation of resources.
- **Localized Strategies**: By addressing city-specific challenges, the company can tailor its retention strategies to each location, potentially reducing churn in high-risk areas by up to 25%. This targeted approach ensures that efforts are focused where they are most needed.
- **Career Development Opportunities**: Clear career progression paths and training opportunities would not only motivate drivers but also reduce attrition by providing a sense of growth and stability. This initiative could lead to a 10% increase in driver tenure.

By implementing these recommendations, the company stands to benefit from a more engaged and loyal driver base, reduced operational costs, and a more efficient allocation of resources. The insights derived from this analysis provide a data-driven foundation for strategic decision-making, positioning the company for long-term success in the competitive ride-sharing market.
